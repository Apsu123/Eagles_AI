A Python-based toolkit for automating image preprocessing, annotation management, and dataset generation workflows used in object detection projects.

This repository helps streamline preparing high-quality datasets — including resizing, augmenting, labeling, and organizing images — for models such as YOLO, Detectron2, and TensorFlow Object Detection API.

🚀 Features

Image Preprocessing

Resize, crop, and normalize images

Convert between formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.)

Remove duplicates and corrupted files

Data Augmentation

Rotation, flipping, brightness/contrast adjustment

Random scaling, translation, and noise injection

Class-balanced augmentation options

Annotation Management

Supports multiple formats: COCO JSON, YOLO TXT, Pascal VOC XML

Annotation conversion between formats

Bounding box visualization and validation

Dataset Creation

Split datasets into train/val/test sets

Generate label files and class mappings

Automatically structure directories for major frameworks

Utilities

Dataset statistics (class counts, image sizes, etc.)

Interactive preview for image + label pairs

CLI & Python API support
